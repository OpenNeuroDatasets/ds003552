19 participants were tested in a virtual reality (VR) reach-to-object task. Data includes EEG and Motion (12 channels: 6DOF right hand, 6DOF head).

Participants experienced visual, visual with vibrotractile or visual with vibrotactile and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) feedback. Participants rated their experience on the Immersion and Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) and their workload on the NASA-TLX.
