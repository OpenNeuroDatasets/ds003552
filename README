19 participants were tested in a virtual reality (VR) reach-to-object task. 

Data include EEG and Motion (12 channels: 6DOF right hand, 6DOF head). Motion is formatted to current preliminary BIDS Motion (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaaLKgWjK5pcISD1MVxHKexB3PZWfE2aAC5HF_pCZWo/edit and https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification).

In the task participants experienced visual, visual with vibrotractile or visual with vibrotactile and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) feedback. Participants rated their experience on the Immersion and Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) and their workload on the NASA-TLX.
